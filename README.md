## Projects
There are a few of my projects, you just have to click on the button that says "Run".

### -*Resilienza Real Estate* 
is a little front-end demo that I pitched to an entrepreneur. The goal here was to compete against Airbnb by redirecting her clients to this web with the promise of generous discounts. We spent a couple of week figuring out how I was going to approach the whole project but at the end, the entrepreneur decided not to invest.

### -*Dashboard* 
This one is also a demo for the Resilienza project, it works as a BI tool where we would anlyze all of the client´s metrics.

### -*H&M* 
This is a clothing store demo that uses a database to show the available products on the front-end. Still a work in progress.

### -*BrandMatch* 
I think this is one of my most complex projects so far. It is a cattle brand "recognition" system. For the training part I used a CNN (MobileNetV2) that generates embeddings and are stored in a vectorial database (ChromaDB). When I want to check is a certain cattle brand is in the system I just upload it through the minimalistic front-end and this image is also converted into embedding to then be compared with the others in the database, returning a similarity match.
